# Generator-stubble

**A Yeoman generator for [Stubble](https://github.com/beardedstudio/stubble), [Bearded's](http://www.bearded.com/) Front End Starter Kit**

**Generator-stubble is very much a work-in-progress**

Generator-stubble is a "starter kit" generator with a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) development workflow. Scaffold your kit/in-browser mockup site with Yo, manage front end packages with [Bower](http://bower.io/), and automate development and build tasks with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). 

Generator-stubble is Bearded's "non-Rails" way of quick-starting a project. Stubble, our normal starter kit, is what we use to rapidly build out our in-browser mockups and then bring into our full-blown Rails sites. As we start working with more clients who have different CMS's, these Rails-based projects aren't the greatest package of files to hand off. Thus, we developed Generator-stubble.

## Features

**Generator-stubble includes:**

- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) on top of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) with automatic preprocessor compiling
- Automatic CSS vendor prefixing with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) templates
- Built in preview server with LiveReload
- An automatic build process that includes concatenation, image optimization, CSS and HTML minification, and JS uglification

## Getting Started

- Check that you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed
